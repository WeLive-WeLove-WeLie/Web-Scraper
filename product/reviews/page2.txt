Switched from andro to i phone... 😅.  Phone color is not that too much dark purple but looks good. In love with big screen.😍😍😍😍 .  I bought a feeling not a phone.
Amazing ☺️ thank you flipkart
The picture quality is good I purchased this i14+ for camera uses
This is a power packed product considering the price. It comes with 33% more battery and 0.7 inches larger display than the base model. Camera is superb in terms of video recording(cinematic mode and normal mode of 4K format). It feels like iphone 14 pro max in hands from the front. A revolutionary product.
Value for money
