Terrific purchase

Camera is really good and battery performance also too good. Now apple has
inbuilt photo edit options which is really nice to make your photos much
better one.

Terrific purchase

This is a power packed product considering the price. It comes with 33% more
battery and 0.7 inches larger display than the base model. Camera is superb in
terms of video recording(cinematic mode and normal mode of 4K format). It
feels like iphone 14 pro max in hands from the front. A revolutionary product.
