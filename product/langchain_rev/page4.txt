Mind-blowing purchase

Simply awesome!  
  
Iphone 13 was already good enough, but 14 offers even more improvement in
every way.  
  
biggest noticeable thing is the display, it's crisp and smooth and colours are
vivid.  
  
And think everyone knows about quality of photos from iPhones!, Iphone 14
offerd best ever camera photo quality yet on iphones.  
  
very happy with the purchase!
