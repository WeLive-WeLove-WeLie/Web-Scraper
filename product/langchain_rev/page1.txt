Very Good

Toys are fabulous according to price, looks sturdy, multicoloured, attractive
and swift. Makeup material Plastic looks good quality.  
  
No need of batteries or Remote control as written in description. It works on
wheel acceleration both forward and backward.  
  
Able to swing 360Â° and do some stunts as rubber on wheels is good enough for
much grip on any surface.  
  
Delivery from Flipkart was quick but low grade packaging carton quality
disappointed.
