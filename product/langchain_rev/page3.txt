Excellent

I upgraded to 13 from xs and my experience with this had been extraordinary .
The user interface and the camera is too good .Just in love with this
extraordinary device .I just shared some photos clicked from this phone so
that everyone can have an idea about how good the camera is compared all other
flagship devices . The lens inside the device is so efficient that it
automatically reduces the noise in the picture making it very crisp and clear
.

Best in the market!

Best phone available at this price point.  
Camera is comparable with entry level DSLR(marvellous dynamic range)  
The performance is unmatchable.Shifted to iOS after 10 years of premium
android smartphones.Go for it without any second thought.
